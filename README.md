# Drum-Kit

## My process

This is my third project. It's a website of drum. By clicking and pressing keys plays different sounds of drums. While working
on this project learned and used in practice some of the javascript elements such as functions, eventlisteners, loops. It was great
experience. Seeking next ones.
